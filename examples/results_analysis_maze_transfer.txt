0.0001 works, gits score 1 at epoch~35, is basically converged around ~42
0.00013(? maybe 0.0002) with decay 0.95 didnt work
0.00017 didnt converge
0.000115 doesnt converge

without reset of weights
0.0001 reaches 1 at 50,  converges after ~60
0.00009 reaches 1 at 30, converges 35
0.000072 reaches 1 at 28, converges ~35
0.00005 reaches 1 at 48, <skipped>

but with smaller replay size:
0.0001 doesnt converge
0.0002 doesnt converge
